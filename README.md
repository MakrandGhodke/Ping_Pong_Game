Welcome to my GitHub repository,
Are you ready to experience a blast from the past? Introducing my Ping Pong Ball Game developed in Java, which brings back the classic arcade game Pong to your screen!

As a Java enthusiast, I have implemented the game logic and graphics user interface using Java Swing library, showcasing my skills in object-oriented design and game development.

The game features two paddles, controlled by players, who hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The player who misses the ball loses a point, and the first player to reach the target score wins the game.

The Ping Pong Ball Game is not only a fun way to spend your free time but also a testament to my passion for programming and game development. So why not give it a try and see if you have what it takes to be a Ping Pong Ball Game champion?
